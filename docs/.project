this is a nmea decoding project.
data initially is a txt
but will come in realtime
this is supposed to run on AWS, primarily on EC2, later refactored for cost/perfomance
data comes from IoT maritime sensors and is supposed to be aggregated on a Redshift/S3

Initial Setup (EC2-Based):

    Extract:
        IoT devices send AIS data to an EC2 instance via TCP/UDP or an IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT).
        EC2 runs a Python script (using pyais) to ingest and decode the NMEA sentences in real-time.
    Transform:
        Decode AIS payloads into structured JSON/dictionaries (e.g., MMSI, lat, lon, speed).
        Add metadata (e.g., timestamp from the message).
        Optionally filter or enrich data (e.g., vessel type lookup).
    Load:
        Write decoded data to Amazon S3 as JSON/Parquet files for batch processing.
        Push to Amazon Redshift for analytics via a staging table.

Optimized Setup (Serverless/Cost-Effective):

    Extract:
        Use AWS IoT Core to receive AIS messages from maritime sensors.
        Route messages to an AWS Lambda function via IoT Rules.
    Transform:
        Lambda function decodes AIS messages (using pyais or a custom decoder).
        Handle multi-part messages by buffering in Amazon DynamoDB (with TTL) until all parts are received.
    Load:
        Write transformed data to S3 (e.g., partitioned by date: s3://ais-data/2024/09/11/).
        Use AWS Glue to crawl S3 and create a Data Catalog.
        Load into Redshift Spectrum or Redshift tables for querying.

Real-Time Considerations:

    Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to buffer incoming AIS messages for high throughput.
    Process streams with Kinesis Data Analytics or Lambda for real-time decoding.
    Aggregate vessel positions in Redshift for dashboards (e.g., via QuickSight).
